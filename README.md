PSX Model
===

## About

This library contains simple POPOs which model common data formats. At the
moment we support the following data formats:

* ActivityStream
* Atom
* Rss
* Swagger
* OpenAPI

These classes can be used standalone or in combination with the `psx/data`
and `psx/schema` package to consume or produce the format.
